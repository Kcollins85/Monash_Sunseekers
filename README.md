About this project


This project aims to use machine learning to help a quest to provide the sales team of a solar power business data that will help them determine the best areas for growth in the solar panel installation business across Australia. We have created a website that reviews APVI’s solar panel data for Australia and shows which suburbs / regions in each state there is the potential to grow business.
 
This project utilizes a datasource collected by Australian PV Institute and Australia Local Government. The original purpose of the data collection was to facilitate installations vs estimated dwellings in each postcode/region/state– to show the number of potential dwellings installations could still be installed, top 10 areas for biggest potential growth in each state,current capacity vs potential kw capacity, capacity per dwelling in each postcode under 10kw & 10-100, capacity per installation

We used SQL to read the data and the project is powered by a Python Flask API and includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript.
